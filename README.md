## 🚀 Overview

This app allows users to:
- Upload an Excel file containing customer data
- Automatically clean and preprocess it
- Predict churn outcomes using a pre-trained Random Forest model
- View predictions in a user-friendly format

> ⚠️ **Note:** Your Excel file **must contain a column named `Churn`** (with binary values like `Yes/No` or `1/0`).
